# Generation-Of-Silicon-Wafer-Images-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks
## ðŸ““ Jupyter Notebook

The notebook [`image_generation (2).ipynb`](image_generation%20(2).ipynb) contains the complete implementation of our **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** used to generate synthetic silicon wafer images.

### Contents:
- Data preprocessing
- Generator and Discriminator model definitions
- Training loop using PyTorch
- Visualization of generated wafer images
- Evaluation and saving models

> ðŸ’¡ This notebook was developed and tested in Google Colab using a dataset of 1000 silicon wafer grayscale images.
